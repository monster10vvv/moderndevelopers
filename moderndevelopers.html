<h1>The problem</h1>
<p> Many websites are relying on underdeveloped software and programs, which creates significant challenges for users.
    The complex processing languages and outdated technologies can lead to navigation issues, slow loading times, and an overall frustrating experience. When websites do not prioritize user-friendly design and robust programming, it becomes increasingly difficult for visitors to find the information they need or complete transactions efficiently.
    This lack of attention to software quality can ultimately harm a site's credibility and user retention, underscoring the importance of investing in modern, well-developed web solutions.</p>

<h1>The solutions</h1>
<p>In resolving this challenge, we intend to launch a full website dedicated to teaching beginners about programming. Our purpose is to provide knowledge on the most recent programming languages and software technologies accessible today. This website will be a helpful resource for those new to the industry, allowing them to learn and develop their skills interestingly.</p>
