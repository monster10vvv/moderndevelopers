<h2> What is !DOCTYPE?</h2>
<p>The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines the document type. It tells the browser that this document is written in HTML, the latest version of HTML. This helps the browser to render the webpage correctly. Without this declaration, browsers may go into “quirks mode,” potentially displaying the page inconsistently.<p>
<br>
<h2>html and /html</h2>
<p>These tags define the start and end of an HTML document. The <html> tag is the root element, which means it contains everything else in the document. All HTML code must be within <html> and </html> tags<p>
<br>
<h2>head and /head</h2>
<p>The <head> section contains meta-information about the document, like the title (displayed on the browser tab), character set, and links to CSS or JavaScript files. This section does not display content directly on the webpage but provides information that can be useful for the browser, search engines, and other services.</p>
<br>
<h2> title and /title </h2>
<p> The title tag sets the title of the webpage that appears in the browser tab. It’s essential for accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO). Each HTML document should have a unique title. </p>
<br>
<h2>body and /body</h2>
<p> The body tag defines the content of the HTML document that will be displayed on the webpage itself. This includes text, images, links, and other elements users see. </p>
<br>
<h2> h1 and /h1 </h2>
<p> The h1 tag is used for a main heading. HTML supports headings from h1 to h6, where h1 tag is the largest and most important, and h6 is the smallest and least important. Headings help structure content, improving readability and SEO. </p>
<br>
<h2> p and /p </h2>
<p> The p tag defines a paragraph. This is used to organize text content within the webpage, breaking it into readable sections </p>
<br>
<h2> Why Close Most Tags? </h2>
<p> In HTML, many elements require an opening (tag) and a closing (/tag) tag to define where an element starts and ends. 
Closing tags are necessary.They help the browser understand where the content for each element begins and ends.
Properly closed tags prevent issues with formatting and layout, especially for larger, more complex HTML documents. </p>

Closing tags are necessary.They help the browser understand where the content for each element begins and ends.
Properly closed tags prevent issues with formatting and layout, especially for larger, more complex HTML documents. </p>

Example: If we didn’t close a paragraph (p) tag, the browser might continue formatting everything after it as part of the paragraph, causing unintended layout issues.
Basic Tags Needed for an HTML Document
At a minimum, every HTML document needs these tags:
!DOCTYPE html: Specifies the HTML version.
html: Root element that contains the entire document.
head: Contains metadata and title (optional but recommended).
title: The webpage title, found within the head.
body: Contains the visible content of the page.
Optional Self-Closing Tags
Some HTML tags are self-closing, meaning they don’t need a separate closing tag. Examples include:
img: Defines an image.
br: Inserts a line break.
hr: Adds a horizontal line or divider.
These elements do not contain content, so they only need a single tag. In HTML, you can omit the trailing slash (/) for these tags, but it is often still used for readability.
